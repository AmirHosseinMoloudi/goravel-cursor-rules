# Laravel Conventions for Goravel

## Naming Conventions
- **Controllers**: PascalCase with "Controller" suffix (e.g., `UserController`)
- **Models**: PascalCase singular (e.g., `User`, `Post`)
- **Routes**: kebab-case or snake_case (e.g., `/user-profile`, `/user_profile`)
- **Database Tables**: snake_case plural (e.g., `users`, `user_profiles`)
- **Database Columns**: snake_case (e.g., `created_at`, `user_id`)

## Directory Structure
```
app/
├── Http/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Middleware/
│   └── Requests/
├── Models/
├── Services/
└── Providers/
```

## Route Organization
- Group related routes using route groups
- Use resource routes for CRUD operations
- Apply middleware at route or controller level
- Use named routes for URL generation

## Controller Patterns
- Keep controllers thin - delegate business logic to services
- Use dependency injection for services
- Return proper HTTP responses with status codes
- Validate input using request classes

## Model Relationships
- Define relationships clearly (hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany)
- Use proper foreign key naming conventions
- Implement soft deletes where appropriate
- Use model events for business logic

## Service Layer
- Create service classes for complex business logic
- Use interfaces for service contracts
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Keep services focused and testable
